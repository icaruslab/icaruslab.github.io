Introduction As described by it&amp;rsquo;s own developer
EOTK provides a tool for deploying HTTP and HTTPS onion sites to provide official onion-networking presences for popular websites.
The result is essentially a &amp;ldquo;man in the middle&amp;rdquo; proxy; you should set them up only for your own sites, or for sites which do not require login credentials of any kind.</description>

Interplanetary File System - IPFS is A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol which is being introduced as the future successor of HTTP.
Being built on the peer-to-peer data exchange system, IPFS is practically difficult to block at least by current censorship techniques and standards, making it worth testing.</description>

WP2Static WP2Static options
WP2Static can be considered as the most optimal plugin for the purpose of generating and updating a static mirror.
This plugin also offers different deployment sub-plugins which can configure direct deployments to platforms like Amazon S3 and GitHub.
However, it&amp;rsquo;s plugin development process itself doesn’t seem to be stable, at the time of writing these documentations, it appears to be transitioning to a new approach and undergoing big changes.</description>

Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) is a data storage service and one of the Amazon Web Services (AWS)
S3 provides object storage service, which means that data is stored and addressed as objects, each object contains it&amp;rsquo;s own data in addition to meta-data and a unique identifier.
Object storage is often used to store big amounts of data that doesn&amp;rsquo;t need the features and structure of the file systems hierarchy.</description>

GitHub is a software development platform using Git version control system, and it provides the ability to serve static web pages through GitHub Pages service.
Note GitHub provides an easy step-by-step guide on how to host a static website on their platform. The guide is available in English, so, in order to avoid redundancy we&amp;rsquo;ll just refer to it here and add a translated version for every available language in our documentations.</description>

      <description>With the first release of Icarus Project&amp;rsquo;s documentations, we are happy to announce the results of our research and documentation process. What is Icarus Project? The project idea started as an individual initiative in 2017, trying to collect, test, document, and develop Internet censorship circumvention techniques as a response to the rise of Internet censorship at the time.
In 2019 the idea started to be realized through one year fellowship program supported by Open Tech Fund (OTF) Information Controls Fellowship program, and hosted by Stratosphere Lab at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CVUT).</description>
